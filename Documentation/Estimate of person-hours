We are estimating that project 3 will take around 5 hours per person. We came to this decision based on group members having to learn python and flask to 
be able to work on the back end. As well we know that the total man hours will not be as much as the first two projects since we are not creating a game 
from scratch and spend time developing the logic that goes into the game.
