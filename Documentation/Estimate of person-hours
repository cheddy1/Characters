    For project 4, our group estimated that it will take about 35 person-hours total to complete. We came to this number by looking at how many hours we spent as a group on
    project 3. We also feel that it will take more time to implement the features that we had discussed originally for our prototype that we did not have time for then. We have
    also been brainstorming other ideas such as an AI text generator, which we felt would add time to learn how the API works and make sure it will work properly with what our
    vision is. Along with adding features to our program, we will have to create a test suite to verify the functionality of our project. We also accounted for the more rigorous
    documentation that would be needed for this project but we do not think it will take too much time to do.
